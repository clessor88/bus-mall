# bus-mall
Welcome to BusMall, a play off SkyMall, which is our week 3 assignment from Codefellows 201.
The object of BusMall is to pick your favorite items out of the 3 pictures shown, at the end of picking multiple pictures,
you will be given your results (what was shown and how many times you've clicked the picture). The data is saved into local storage, so
when you come back to the page later, or refresh the page, everything you picked before is saved on your results chart.
